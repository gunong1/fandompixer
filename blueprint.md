# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a web application called "Fandom Pixel," a collaborative art canvas where users can claim pixels to create logos for their favorite fandoms. The application is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it features a pannable, zoomable canvas, a minimap for navigation, and UI panels that display information about the canvas and selected pixels.

## Project Structure

*   `index.html`: The main entry point of the application.
*   `style.css`: Contains all the styles for the application.
*   `main.js`: Contains all the JavaScript for the application.

## Features

*   **Canvas:** The main canvas is a 1000x1000 pixel grid that can be panned and zoomed.
*   **Minimap:** A small minimap in the corner of the screen shows the user's current viewport.
*   **UI Panels:** Several UI panels display information about the application, such as the title, the currently selected pixel, and stats about the canvas.

### Current Plan
